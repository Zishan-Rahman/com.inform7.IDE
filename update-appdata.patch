     <p>
+      Inform 7 IDE, also known as GNOME Inform, is a development environment
+      for building interactive fiction on Linux with the Inform design system.
+      Initially in development since 2006, and stemming from prior development
+      of the Inform system, which was originally released in 1993, the system
+      was released as free and open-source software under the Artistic License
+      2.0 in 2022. This IDE is built with GNOME and released as free-and-open-source
+      software under the GPLv3.

       Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural
       language, a new medium of writing which came out of the "text adventure"
       games of the 1980s.

       In a single evening with Inform, it's possible to write a vignette and
       publish it as an interactive website, playable on any browser.

+      The Inform project was created by Graham Nelson in 1993 and first came to
+      the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop in 1995, and is now available as an app.
+      It combines the core Inform software with full documentation, including two
+      books and nearly 500 fully working Examples. Connecting to the Inform website,
+      it can automatically download and update extensions from a fully curated Public
+      Library used by the world-wide Inform community. The app offers richly detailed
+      indexing of projects and scales from tiny fictions like "Kate is a woman in the
+      Research Lab" right up to enormous imaginary worlds whose source text runs to
+      over 3 million words. Features for automated testing, packaging and releasing
+      round out a fully-featured development environment for IF.

+      Inform is free, with no strings attached. What you make with it is yours, to
+      publish on your website, sell, or give to your friends. There's a vibrant community
+      of users who welcome newcomers (and the app will help you find a high-traffic forum
+      for discussions). Lastly, Inform is continuously maintained and developed. All bug
+      reports are examined and acted on (and the app will show you how to post them).
